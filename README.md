What is the aim of this project?
For me it started as making a clone to a notorious game we all know. Eventually I've started to get attached, and I'm going to keep making this. And I'm also developing an engine around it.

Why play this?
As it is right, it's boring, but eventually I will make it more compelling to play.

Can I fork/branch this?
Sure, just don't forget to credit me and contribute to this project. I'm open to pulling, only if I approve the quality of code.

Can I take parts of your code and use it?
Only if you credit this project in an easily accessible manner such as your README.
