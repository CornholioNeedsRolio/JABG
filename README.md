./build.py should only work on linux, I'm not sure if I can get it the securityRiskOS(aka windows) to run, but if you feel like it go for it
params:
-b rebuilds everything
-r run after compiling
-n build for windows, and run under wine

This is a game I'm working on at the moment, I don't expect it to be comercial, after all this is a learning project.
Also don't yoink my code without crediting me, it hurts to not get credit :P


Dependencies:
-SDL2(pacman -S sdl2)
-GLM(pacman -S glm)
-GLU
-opengl
